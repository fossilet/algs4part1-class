Algorithms, Part I
==================

### August 12th 2012 Session

This repository contains all my solutions to Coursera's [Algorithms Part
1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) (by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin
Wayne, Princeton University) programming assignments.

The course is based around a small subset of Java, and require the use of two
provided libraries (algs4.jar and stdlib.jar), which can be found on the
[booksite](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).
